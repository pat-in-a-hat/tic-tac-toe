# Tic Tac Toe - Montana Code School Week 11
### Author - Patrick Warner - patinahat
### 10/22

## Overview:
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that runs on any browser or mobile device. 

For my own practice, I utilized some jquery in the initial 'play' button action as a personal exercise, but it is mostly made using javascript DOM methods. Formatting is mainly Bootstrap, with some CSS grid and flexbox to make the nice tic tac toe squares.

-----------------------------------------------------
## Requirements:
Please refer to the packages.json file or run 'npm  install' once the git repository is cloned to acquire the necessary packages (in this case just jquery and bootstrap).

# Enjoy!

# Tic Tac Toe - Montana Code School Week 11

## Overview:
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that runs on any browser or mobile device. 

For my own practice, I utilized some jquery in the initial 'play' button action as a personal exercise, but it is mostly made using javascript DOM methods. Formatting is mainly Bootstrap, with some CSS grid and flexbox to make the nice tic tac toe squares. The logic circuit, which determines when a win or tie occurs, utilizes a simple Javascript 'referee' class that iterates through possible scenarios after every click event.

:hammer_and_wrench: Would like to return to this at some point to add some cleaner CSS styling, build a more complex logic system, and ensure full mobile functionality. Too busy with other bootcamp projects to return focus here just yet.

## Requirements:
Please refer to the packages.json file or run 'npm  install' once the git repository is cloned to acquire the necessary packages (in this case just jquery and bootstrap).

# Enjoy!
